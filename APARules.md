# Bibliography Rules and Embedded Citations

## When to Cite (Source: JFSS eLibrary "Source It!")

When you use ideas, pictures, maps or quotations from other sources, you must give those sources credit. Even if you paraphrase or summarize the original, you still must give credit. All items must be cited in the text of your essay or report with embedded citations (also known as an in-text citations), endnotes or footnotes. Also, each item must be described in more detail at the end of the document in the "Works Cited", "References" or "Bibliography" page. The specifics for citing will vary depending on the style that your instructor requests. Failure to give credit to the original author is considered plagiarism, which is a serious academic offence. Most schools will assign a mark of zero to a submission that is plagiarized.

**What must be Cited:**

- Quotations
- Images, art, maps, photographs, charts
- Paraphrased information
- Summarized information
- Cartoons
- Advertisements
- Audio Visual Materials (music, radio, DVD, MP3 files, broadcast etc.)
- Statistics

**What is not Cited:**

- Your own ideas or analysis
- Primary research (surveys you conducted)
- Commonly known information (i.e.: the earth is round, we breathe oxygen, Canada has 10 provinces, the prime minister of Canada)
- *Wikipedia* or other openly edited wikis. Wikis should only be used for background information and to create a list of keywords to use in your search. They should not normally be quoted.

## __Bibliography Style Formatting__

The two main bibliography formats used are APA (American Psychological Association) and MLA (Modern Language Association). No matter which format used these general rules apply:

- The bibliography page shouldbe on a separate page from the rest of your document
- Put your last name in the top right header of your page
- Sources should be listed **alphabetically**
- Do **NOT** use bullet points or number your sources
- **Indent after the first line**
  - Choose **Page Layout -> Paragraph -> Indentation -> Special -> Hanging**
- There are several Citation Guides available to assist you
